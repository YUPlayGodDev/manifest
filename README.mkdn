Welcome to YUPlayGod Dev
=========== 

Getting Started 
--------------- 

To get started with the source, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html). 

To initialize your local repository using the YUPlayGod trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/YUPlayGodDev/manifest.git -b android-6.0.1 

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -f -jX where X is the number of jobs.
